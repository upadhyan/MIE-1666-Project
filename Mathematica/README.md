# Interactive Proof of Theorem 3.1

**Theorem 3.1:** Given a finite discretisation of $\lambda$, an infinite family of MILP instances can be constructed 
that do not converge to optimality, but would converge for an infinite amount of alternative $\lambda$ values.

An interactive proof of Theorem 3.1 is provided in `cut-selector-3d.nb`. Open it in Mathematica and play around as
you wish. The cells are ordered and above each cell is the Lemma the cell proves and an explanation
on why it is sufficient.
